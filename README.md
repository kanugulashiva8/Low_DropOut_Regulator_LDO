# Low Dropout Regulator LDO
It's a Cadence virtuoso design project on "Low Dropout Regulator LDO".
The technology library used is gpdk180nm.
Designed for Regulted Output Voltage of ~1.54V for reference voltage of ~1.1V.
Ensured Drop-Out Voltage to be minimum for good power efficiency and is ~260mV.
Achieved Line Regulation as only ~69uV Output variation is observed for a ~400mV Supply change.
Achieved Load Regulation as only ~530uV Output variation is observed for a ~1mA Load current change.
Achieved Load & Line Regulation as only ~738uV maximum Output variation is observed for a ~1mA Load current and ~300mV Supply change.
