Regulated O/P of ~1.54V for ref ~1.1V. Drop-Out Voltage is ~260mV. Line Regulation as ~ 69uV O/P variation is observed for a ~ 400mV Supply change. Load Regulation as ~ 530uV O/P variation is observed for a ~ 1mA Load current change. Load &amp; Line Regulation as ~738uV max O/P variation is observed for a ~1mA Load current and ~300mV Supply change.

# Design of Low Dropout Regulator LDO
• Designed for Regulted Output Voltage of approx 1.54V for reference voltage of approx 1.1V.
• Ensured Drop-Out Voltage to be minimum for good power efficiency and is approx 260mV.
• Achieved Line Regulation as only approx 69uV Output variation is observed for a approx 400mV Supply change.
• Achieved Load Regulation as only approx 530uV Output variation is observed for a approx 1mA Load current change.
• Achieved Load & Line Regulation as only approx 738uV maximum Output variation is observed for a approx 1mA Load
current and approx 300mV Supply change.
